Title: Modern C++ for Absolute Beginners - A Friendly Introduction
By: Slobodan Dmitrovic
Abstract: Learn the C++ programming language in a structured, straightforward, and friendly manner. This book teaches the basics of the modern C++ programming language, C++ Standard Library, and modern C++ standards. No previous programming experience is required.

C++ is a language like no other, surprising in its complexity, yet wonderfully sleek and elegant in so many ways. It is also a language that cannot be learned by guessing, one that is easy to get wrong and challenging to get right. To overcome this, each section is filled with real-world examples that gradually increase in complexity. Modern C++ for Absolute Beginners teaches more than just programming in C++20. It provides a solid C++ foundation to build upon.

The author takes you through the C++ programming language, the Standard Library, and the C++11 to C++20 standard basics. Each chapter is accompanied by the right amount of theory and plenty of source code examples.

You will work with C++20 features and standards, yet you will also compare and take a look into previous versions of C++. You will do so with plenty of relevant source code examples.
